Skill Development Thread
------------------------

(-) Develop an open-source Rust library for pure functional programming ([pure-fun](https://github.com/rust-hub/pure-fun))

Rust-Hub
--------

Initially, the rust-hub.org web site will provide a Rust development social network with intended Cy
features implemented standalone -- with no IDE support. It will be implemented on a Rust port of
[Play Framework](http://playframework.org/), although porting just enough of Play to serve
Rust-Hub's immediate needs (unless other developers join in to help finish the port for its own
value).

( ) Implement the bare bones of play-rust.

( ) Implement the bare bones of rust-hub.org.

( ) Implement a Hoogle-like Rust library search.

( ) Implement "Login with GitHub".


IDE Design Thread
-----------------

(!) Develop IDE use cases.

( ) Choose a UI mockup environment.

( ) Experiment with Learnable Programming UIs in the mockup environment.


IDE Development Thread
----------------------

(!) Determine how debugger technology and interpreter technology will interrelate.

( ) Develop a Rust "interpreter", hopefully just with LLVM tools.

( ) Choose the IDE rendering platform.  ([Irrlicht](http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/) plus [Crazy Eddie's GUI](http://www.cegui.org.uk/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)?)

( ) Develop a competent text editor or editor integration in Rust.

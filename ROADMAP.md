Language Design Thread
----------------------

(!) Work through Go's spec, writing a corresponding Cy spec.

(!) Implement a trivial Go-to-Go translator by forking the appropriate standard Go packages.

( ) Implement a Cy compilation/execution environment in Go based on the Go-to-Go translator, 
    where initially Cy == Go.

( ) Modify the Go-to-Go translator step by step into a Cy-to-Go translator.

( ) Get some experience writing Cy programs in a text editor and iterate on the language design.


IDE Design Thread
-----------------

(!) Develop IDE use cases.

( ) Choose a UI mockup environment.

( ) Experiment with Learnable Programming UIs in the mockup environment.


IDE Development Thread
----------------------

( ) Develop a Go interpreter. (Fork from [sbinet/go-eval](https://github.com/sbinet/go-eval)?)

( ) Choose the IDE platform.  ([Irrlicht](http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/)?)

( ) Develop a competent text editor or editor integration in Go.
